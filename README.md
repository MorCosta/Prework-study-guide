# Don't panic. A prework study guide for beginners.

## I created this guide because learn how to code can be challenging. Specially for someone that has no knowledge of the subject!...Like me. This is why I wanted to share my notes with you. This will (hopefully)help you to sail through subjects like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. And remeber...don't panic!

Through this guide you can access the notes I took about the four main subjects: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. 
You can also open the ChromeDevTools console to check the HTML code used to create the guide, its style (CSS), and the console to see the JavaScript at work!
